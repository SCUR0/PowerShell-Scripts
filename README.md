# PowerShell-Scripts
Personal collection of powershell scripts used at home and a few work scripts. These were designed to run on Powershell for Windows.

***

### Disable-UpdateReboot.ps1

  A Powershell script that will adjust the reboot task permissions in update orchestrator to prevent windows from automatically rebooting. The script will perminently disable auto reboot until the next feature update. This is due to how windows wipes the windows directory during updates.
  
  Changes have been made for 1809. I have not tested for newer versions and am no longer developing this script.
  
## Active Directory

These use a config hash that needs to be modified to match local enviroment. These were designed for my work center.

### Archive-UserFiles.ps1

Searches multiple network locations for user files and then moves via robocopy.

### Get-LAPSPass.ps1

Simple GUI script that does not require any modules to lookup LAPS password. I created it to help coworkers with LAPS.

### Remove-UserHybrid.ps1

Used for account closure in a hyprid office 365 enviroment. No files, accounts, or mailboxes are deleted, instead they are moved to archive locations. Archive-UserFiles.ps1 and ShareOnlineEmailAccount.ps1 are included as part of the script.

### Search-GroupPolicy.ps1

Simple script used to search for simple string in domain group policies.

### Share-OnlineEmailAccount.ps1

Set a mailbox to be shared to another via office 365.

## System-Setup

### Set-DefaultWallpaper.ps1

Sets default wallpaper for computer but allows users to change.

This is run during MDT image process. You will need the make the required resolutions and place in a 4k folder. See [here](https://www.winsysadminblog.com/2016/08/setting-the-default-wallpaper-on-a-windows-10-image-deployment-through-mdt/) for details on resolutions

### Remove-OrphanedPrinters.ps1

Remove printers not found on print server. Currently only supports one print server.

### Remove-Win10Apps.ps1

Common Microsoft "bloat" is checked for and removed.

It is recommended to run this during the image process such as an MDT task sequence.

## Tasks

### Backup-UserFiles.ps1

  Script used to backup user folders to google drive.

### Backup-VMs.ps1

  Simple script that exports a copy of all VMs to a backup directory as well as compresses for archive with 7zip if installed.

### Check-FileHistoryStatus.ps1

  Filehistory on windows 8-10 is known for randomly failing to run. I enjoy the feature of FileHistory tracking of files so I created a script that will email you if it has not ran in the specified time range.

### Clear-StaleDNSRecord.ps1
  
  This script was made to help combat always-on-vpn's behavior to recycle dhcp leases for other clients. Also removes unresponsive clients in dns.

### Clear-StuckPrintQueue.ps1
  
  Checks for stuck print jobs on print server. It will first attempt to remove the errored job gracefully. If that fails it will stop the print service and remove job from files.

### Get-PendingRestarts.ps1
  
  Both scripts are needed if you want the process to be hidden from the user except for prompts. 
  
  If you want to launch silently with the vbs script, both scripts **need to be placed in** `$env:APPDATA\AdminScripts\`. 
  
  Create a group policy to create a scheduled task to run `Get-PendingRestartSilent.vbs` throughout the day. **Run vbs script as user not system.**
  
  To handle situations where no user is logged in, create another scheduled task that runs as system with the same arguments. VBS script is not needed for system tasks.
  
### Scrub-Snapraid.ps1

  Perform sync and then a scrub. Notify for errors.

### Send-Gmail.ps1

  Simple script to send smpt email via gmail.

### Send-UPSOutageEmail.ps1

  Send SMTP email notifications for UPS devices that don't offer sending emails (Powerchute Personal Edition)
  
### Sync-Snapraid.ps1

  Check for differences before syncing. If differences are found, sync and notify for errors.

### Set-NTFSCompression.ps1
  
  Compress specified folders using NTFS compression. Very useful for saving space in areas that don't have high IO. I was unable to find any negative performance impact.

### Update-PlexService.ps1
  
  Update plex if you are running it as a service.
  
## Tools

### Batch-FirewallRules.ps1
  
  Quickly create firewall rules on windows using text file of IP ranges. Useful for geo blocking.

### Batch-UFWConfig.ps1
  
  This script takes a text file of IPs or IP subnets and converts it to be used with UFW config files. Useful for IP Geo firewall rules. You can copy paste output into config file to add rules.

This script is used to automatically compact all of your dynamic virtual disks on all of your VMs. It will shut down VM if running, compact, and then boot VM if it was running before.

  Recusive NTFS uncompression for a directory or more.

Script uses Register-ScheduledTask instead of Invoke-WUInstall because of issues/bugs on non domain computers.
